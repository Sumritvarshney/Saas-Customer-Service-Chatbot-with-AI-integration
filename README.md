# SaaS Customer Service Chatbot with AI Integration  

A **full-stack SaaS Customer Service Chatbot** built using **React, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication**.  
This project demonstrates how AI-powered chatbots can enhance customer support for SaaS businesses by providing **real-time query handling, authentication, and scalability**.  

> ⚡ Note: Since AI APIs now require a **paid account**, a **mock API call** has been implemented to simulate chatbot responses. This highlights the **problem-solving approach** to demonstrate functionality without incurring costs.

## 🚀 Features  
- **AI-Powered Chatbot** (mocked for demo due to API restrictions)  
- **Secure Authentication** with JWT for Sign-Up & Login  
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (frontend) + Express/Node.js (backend) + MongoDB (database)  
- **Scalable SaaS Solution** for customer service automation  
- **Problem-Solving Highlight**: Overcame API cost barriers by integrating a mock fallback system

📌 Problem Solving Highlight

Earlier, OpenAI’s free API access allowed easy chatbot integration. Now, it requires a paid account.
To ensure functionality for demonstration and learning purposes, a mock AI API call was implemented.
This showcases adaptability, problem-solving, and ability to deliver under constraints.
/backend → Express.js + MongoDB + JWT auth
