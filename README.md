# SaaS Customer Service Chatbot with AI Integration  

A **full-stack SaaS Customer Service Chatbot** built using **React, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication**.  
This project demonstrates how AI-powered chatbots can enhance customer support for SaaS businesses by providing **real-time query handling, authentication, and scalability**.  

> ‚ö° Note: Since AI APIs now require a **paid account**, a **mock API call** has been implemented to simulate chatbot responses. This highlights the **problem-solving approach** to demonstrate functionality without incurring costs.
